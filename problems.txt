Discrepancies between Game Design and Implementation (Corrected)

### Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Followers:**
    *   The entire follower system (Magistrates, Farmers, Monks, Scouts) is absent from the game. This is a core feature that is completely missing from both the frontend and backend.

*   **Resource Management:**
    *   **Real-Time Generation:** The game design calls for real-time resource generation from tiles with followers. The current implementation in `backend/src/game_room.py` only gives players a starting amount of resources, with no continuous generation.
    *   **Resource Caps:** The game design specifies resource caps to prevent hoarding. These are not implemented in `backend/src/models/game_state.py`.

*   **Real-Time Combat:**
    *   **Rock-Paper-Scissors:** The game design's rock-paper-scissors combat system (Infantry > Archers > Knights > Infantry) is not implemented in `backend/src/combat_system.py`. Combat is currently a simple damage-per-second calculation.
    *   **Raiding:** The ability to raid enemy tiles for resources is not implemented in `backend/src/combat_system.py`.

### Unit Stats

*   The unit stats in `backend/src/models/unit.py` do not match the game design document. For example, the `Knight` has a speed of 1.2, while the `Archer` has a speed of 1.0, which contradicts the design where archers should be faster.

### Tech Trees

*   The entire tech tree and stage progression system (Manor, Duchy, Kingdom) is completely absent from the game.

### User Interface

*   **Tile Selection:** The UI for tile selection exists, but it only ever presents one tile, not a choice of three as specified in the game design.
    *   **Files:** `frontend/src/js/ui-manager.js`, `backend/src/game_room.py`
*   **Follower Management:** The UI for placing and managing followers is not implemented.
*   **Tech Menu:** The UI for the tech tree is not implemented.
