Discrepancies between Game Design and Implementation (Corrected)

### Gameplay Mechanics

*   **Tile Placement:**
    *   **15-Second Timer:** The game design specifies a 15-second timer for tile placement. The `CycleTimer` in `frontend/src/js/cycle-timer.js` exists, but it is not connected to the actual tile placement logic in `frontend/src/js/game.js` to enforce a time limit.
    *   **Stored Placements:** The ability to "bank" up to three tile placements is not implemented.
        *   **File:** `frontend/src/js/game.js`
    *   **Tile Selection:** The game design states that players should be able to choose one of three random tiles. The current implementation in `frontend/src/js/ui-manager.js` and `backend/src/game_room.py` only offers a single, predetermined tile, not a choice of three.
    *   **Relaxed Connection Rules:** The game design specifies that tiles must connect to an existing tile in the player's territory. The current implementation in `frontend/src/js/tile-system.js` allows placing tiles anywhere on the grid, without checking for adjacency.

*   **Followers:**
    *   The entire follower system (Magistrates, Farmers, Monks, Scouts) is absent from the game. This is a core feature that is completely missing from both the frontend and backend.

*   **Resource Management:**
    *   **Real-Time Generation:** The game design calls for real-time resource generation from tiles with followers. The current implementation in `backend/src/game_room.py` only gives players a starting amount of resources, with no continuous generation.
    *   **Resource Caps:** The game design specifies resource caps to prevent hoarding. These are not implemented in `backend/src/models/game_state.py`.

*   **Real-Time Combat:**
    *   **Rock-Paper-Scissors:** The game design's rock-paper-scissors combat system (Infantry > Archers > Knights > Infantry) is not implemented in `backend/src/combat_system.py`. Combat is currently a simple damage-per-second calculation.
    *   **Raiding:** The ability to raid enemy tiles for resources is not implemented in `backend/src/combat_system.py`.

*   **Victory Condition:**
    *   The victory condition is partially implemented. While destroying the enemy capital leads to victory, the alternative condition of eliminating a player by destroying all their followers and tiles is not implemented, as followers are missing. This is a gap in `backend/src/game_room.py`.

### Tile Types

*   **Core Tiles:**
    *   **Marsh:** The `Marsh` tile is implemented, but it does not slow down units as described in the game design. The pathfinding logic in `backend/src/pathfinding.py` does not account for this.
*   **Resource Tiles:**
    *   `Mine` and `Orchard` tiles, which are supposed to be scattered across the map, are not implemented.
*   **Special Tiles:**
    *   `Barracks` and `Watchtower` tiles are not implemented.

### Unit Stats

*   The unit stats in `backend/src/models/unit.py` do not match the game design document. For example, the `Knight` has a speed of 1.2, while the `Archer` has a speed of 1.0, which contradicts the design where archers should be faster.

### Tech Trees

*   The entire tech tree and stage progression system (Manor, Duchy, Kingdom) is completely absent from the game.

### User Interface

*   **Tile Selection:** The UI for tile selection exists, but it only ever presents one tile, not a choice of three as specified in the game design.
    *   **Files:** `frontend/src/js/ui-manager.js`, `backend/src/game_room.py`
*   **Follower Management:** The UI for placing and managing followers is not implemented.
*   **Tech Menu:** The UI for the tech tree is not implemented.
