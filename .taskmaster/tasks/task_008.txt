# Task ID: 8
# Title: Conquest & Watchtower Mechanics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add capital HP, elimination flow, raiding, tile capture, and watchtower defense aura.
# Details:
Server-side:
• Tile model gains `capturable:bool`.
• Damage rules: siege ×2 vs buildings.
• On capital hp<=0 ⇒ mark player eliminated, remove from tile selection cycle, broadcast victory check.
• Raiding: attacker action steals 0.1 × defender tile resources, updates both inventories.
• Watchtower: when unit enters aura radius=2, apply defBuff=1.25 in combat calc.
Client:
• Capital hp bar UI, elimination banners.


# Test Strategy:
Integration test: python simulate players, destroy capital ⇒ eliminated flag true, placement timer adjusts.
Unit tests for aura function defBuff().
