Connected ToastManager to UIManager to surface errors via in-game toasts. Added deep logging around tile updates and capital placement to trace server overrides. Integrated renderUnits() with colored circle sprites and click handling that dispatches unit:click events for selection. Applied version bump and cache-busting to v1.5 for all bundles. Expanded test suite (UIManager methods, unit click detection) and confirmed resolution of showPlacementMode/showError runtime errors; unit selection functioning.
