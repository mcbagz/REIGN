Deserialization of remote units omits `maxHp`, breaking health text formatting.  \n3. Pointer events are only re-attached for the local player’s units after the render refactor, leaving enemy units non-interactive.\n\nImmediate action items\n• Inside UnitSystem.render(): ensure sprite creation branch executes for all owners; remove owner==localPlayer guard.  \n• Extend Unit.serialize/deserialize to include `maxHp`; update backend schema + shared/types.ts accordingly.  \n• Re-bind `pointerover`, `pointerout`, and `pointerdown` listeners for every rendered unit regardless of owner; confirm `interactive=true` survives texture swap.  \n• Add cross-player selection test: simulate two WebSocket clients, spawn 5 units each, verify both can select friend & foe units and see correct health values.  \n• Visual QA: both clients at zoom levels 0.75/1/1.5 show proper unit sprites, hover stats panel, and selection outline.\n\nBlocker priority remains P0 until both local and remote unit selection/rendering pass the above checks.\n</info added on 2025-07-17T19:07:04.185Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-17T19:18:30.683Z>\nMixed Results – Partial Fix (QA build 2025-07-19)\n\nVerified fixes\n• Proper sprites and health bars render for all units on both clients  \n• “100/undefined” HP label resolved (maxHp now serialized)  \n• Cross-player rendering passes regression matrix at zoom levels 0.75 / 1 / 1.5  \n\nRemaining defects\n• Player-2 HUD incorrectly displays “Player 1” in the nameplate  \n• Player-2 can select Player-1’s units but cannot select their own  \n• Building interaction logic functions correctly, suggesting mismatch isolated to player-id resolution in HUD and UnitSelection only  \n\nRoot cause hypothesis\n`gameState.localPlayer` is overwritten by the first received `join` packet on secondary clients, causing:\n– UIHeader.renderPlayerName() to show host’s id  \n– UnitSelection.canSelect() to reverse ownership check  \nBuildingController pulls from `session.playerId`, so it remains correct.\n\nNext steps (P0)\n1. Introduce unified `PlayerContext.getLocalId()` sourced from `session.playerId`; deprecate other getters.  \n2. Refactor UnitSelection.canSelect() and UIHeader.renderPlayerName() to use PlayerContext.  \n3. Add on-connect listener to update HUD once player id is confirmed.  \n4.

            "description": "Resolve the critical bug where units move in straight lines instead of following the tile grid when commanded to move.",
            "details": "Unit movement currently ignores the tile-based grid system and moves directly from point A to B, which breaks the intended gameplay mechanics and will interfere with conquest features like terrain effects and pathfinding.\n\n• Investigate unit movement command processing\n• Ensure movement uses the grid-based pathfinding system implemented in Task 5\n• Verify units move tile-by-tile rather than in straight lines\n• Fix integration between frontend movement commands and backend pathfinding\n• Implement proper animation that follows the calculated path\n• Test movement across different terrain types (fields, marshes, etc.)\n• Ensure movement respects unit speed and terrain modifiers\n\nThis is a P0 blocker for conquest mechanics since proper unit movement is essential for tactical combat.\n<info added on 2025-07-17T20:51:37.535Z>\nCurrent Problem:\nUnits still travel in straight lines, bypassing the tile grid and pathfinding system, which nullifies terrain effects and breaks conquest mechanics.\n\nInvestigation Plan:\n1. Review the A* grid pathfinding module from Task 5 to confirm it outputs correct tile sequences.\n2. Trace the full command flow (client move request → WebSocket → server Room.mutate → broadcast) to see where path data is lost or ignored.\n3. Verify that the front-end coroutine responsible for movement receives a tile list, not just a destination point.\n4. Insert logging/breakpoints on both client and server to pinpoint the exact stage where linear interpolation replaces discrete tile steps.\n5. Refactor any code paths that bypass the pathfinder, ensuring units advance tile-by-tile with speed and terrain modifiers applied, and update animations to consume the validated path.\n</info added on 2025-07-17T20:51:37.535Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-17T20:52:30.030Z>\nRoot cause found in backend/src/main.py (handle_move_unit): pathfinder returns correct tile list but unit coordinates are overwritten by an “instant movement” shortcut that teleports the unit.  \n\nRequired fix  \n• Delete the direct coordinate assignment and call UnitSystem.move_unit(unit, path) to enqueue the tile sequence.  \n• Set unit.status = UnitStatus.MOVING so MovementSystem.update_units() advances the unit during the server tick loop.  \n\nImplementation steps  \n1. Refactor handle_move_unit as above; add defensive check to reject empty paths.  \n2. Remove the “Unit completes movement instantly for now” comment and any related feature flags.  \n3. Add pytest: send move command across 5-tile mixed-terrain path, assert intermediate positions are broadcast each tick and final arrival time matches speed × terrain modifiers.  \n4. Front-end: ensure coroutine reads successive state broadcasts and plays walk animation; no interpolation unless tweening between consecutive grid tiles.  \n5. Regression QA: move 20 units simultaneously across obstacles; verify none skip tiles or ignore terrain.  \n\nAcceptance criteria: Units advance tile-by-tile on both server and client, terrain modifiers applied, and no teleportation occurs.\n</info added on 2025-07-17T20:52:30.030Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-17T22:26:21.097Z>\nCrash Fix – Event Handling during Movement  \n• Root cause: `_update_game_state()` always accessed `event['new_position']`; arrival events only provide `position`, triggering a KeyError that stopped the server tick loop once any unit reached its destination.  \n• Patched `game_room.py` to switch on `event['type']`, pulling `new_position` for movement events and `position` for arrival events, with a safe fallback for unknown types.  \n• Stress-test: 10 units on 7-tile mixed-terrain paths for 5 min ⇒ zero crashes, continuous state broadcasts, resource ticks unaffected, new move commands accepted post-arrival.  \n• With both grid-based pathfinding and stable event handling in place, unit movement is now production-ready for conquest mechanics.\n</info added on 2025-07-17T22:26:21.097Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-17T22:43:46.331Z>\nAdditional enhancements requested:\n\n• Raise the unit move cap to 10 tiles. Update `_get_unit_move_distance()` in `backend/src/main.py`  \n  – Infantry 10, Archer 10, Knight 10, Siege 10, Default 10.\n\n• Enforce tile-only travel. Inject `valid_tile_positions` into `Pathfinder.find_path()`, block routes that traverse empty grid squares, and pass this validation data from `handle_move_unit()` → `UnitSystem.move_unit()`.\n\n• Add/adjust code:\n  – `backend/src/pathfinding.py`: tile-validation filter.  \n  – `backend/src/models/unit.py`: accept tile constraints in `move_unit()`.  \n  – `backend/src/main.py`: collect tile set from game state and forward to pathfinder.\n\n• Test suite expansion:\n  – `test_tile_only_movement()` verifies rejection of illegal paths.  \n  – `test_tile_validation_with_detour()` checks alternate routing around empty squares.  \n  – Existing 15 pathfinding cases + 2 new ones = 17; all must pass.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n 1. Single move command may cover up to 10 contiguous tiles, terrain costs still applied.  \n 2. Units never cross or stop on non-tile grid squares; command is rejected or rerouted if necessary.  \n 3. Pathfinding remains deterministic and performant (<2 ms for 50×50 grid).  \n 4. Front-end visually confirms legal path (highlight) and animates tile-by-tile without interpolation across gaps.\n</info added on 2025-07-17T22:43:46.331Z>",

        "details": "This task addresses fundamental issues where client and server manage game state independently, making the server the single source of truth for all game logic in multiplayer.\n\n1.  **Client Game State Initialization:** Modify the client to *not* initialize its own game state in multiplayer mode. Instead, the client will wait for and fully rely on the initial game state broadcast from the server upon connection.\n2.  **Server Game State Initialization:** Implement comprehensive server-side game initialization logic. This includes generating the game map, strategically placing capitals, scattering initial resources, and setting up initial player states. This logic should be triggered when a new game room is created (building upon Task 6).\n3.  **Migrate Client-Side Systems to Server:** Identify and move all game logic currently running on the client (e.g., resource generation, tile management, unit movement, combat calculations, turn progression, tile placement validation, worker management, resource calculation) to the server. The client's role in multiplayer will be strictly limited to rendering the game state received from the server and sending user input commands.\n4.  **Implement Sophisticated Server-Side Game Logic:** Develop or port all necessary complex game logic to the server, including:\n    *   Rigorous tile placement validation (adjacency rules, resource costs, terrain compatibility).\n    *   Worker assignment and resource collection rate calculations.\n    *   Accurate resource generation, consumption, and storage management.\n    *   Unit movement pathfinding and validation.\n    *   Comprehensive combat resolution mechanics.\n    *   Integration points for future server-side logic from tasks like Tech Tree (Task 9) and Conquest (Task 8).\n5.  **Standardize Data Structures:** Resolve data structure mismatches (e.g., client Maps vs. server Lists). Define and enforce consistent data schemas (using the `/shared` folder as per Task 1) for all game state objects, tiles, units, and commands. Utilize Pydantic for server-side validation and serialization, and ensure client-side TypeScript interfaces align perfectly for JSON serialization/deserialization.\n6.  **Implement Server-Driven Turn-Based Logic:**\n    *   Establish a server-authoritative turn system, managing player order and active turns.\n    *   Control the 15-second tile placement cycle on the server, broadcasting remaining time to clients.\n    *   Server validates and processes tile placements only for the active player and within the allocated time limit.\n    *   Implement logic for passing turns, handling skipped turns, and managing player elimination.\n7.  **Integrate Unit Training System:** Implement the complete unit training logic on the server, including:\n    *   Validation of training prerequisites (resources, tech).\n    *   Accurate deduction of resources.\n    *   Management of training queues and timers.\n    *   Spawning of new units onto the game map.\n8.  **Refine WebSocket State Synchronization:** Define a clear, efficient, and consistent WebSocket message format for state updates and client commands. Implement a robust diffing/patching mechanism for state updates to minimize bandwidth, ensuring the server sends the full authoritative state periodically or on significant changes. All server-side state mutations must trigger appropriate broadcasts to connected clients.",

Confirm the 15-second timer and turn progression logic functions as expected.\n    *   **Resource & Unit Management:** Perform actions that consume or generate resources (e.g., placing tiles, training units); verify server-side resource calculations are accurate and reflected on all clients. Test the full unit training lifecycle, ensuring resources are deducted, units appear after training time, and all clients see the new units.\n    *   **Data Consistency Under Load:** Introduce network latency (e.g., using browser DevTools throttling) and perform rapid actions from multiple clients. Verify that no state desynchronization occurs and that any client-side predictions are correctly reconciled by authoritative server updates.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Send malformed commands or commands with invalid data from clients; verify the server responds with appropriate error messages and maintains stability.\n3.  **Manual Multiplayer Playtesting:** Conduct extensive manual playtesting with 2-4 players (locally or across a network) to ensure all game mechanics (tile placement, resource generation, unit training, turn cycle, etc.) function correctly, consistently, and without desyncs or unexpected behavior throughout a full game session.\n4.  **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor server CPU and memory usage under simulated load (e.g., 4 players performing rapid actions) to ensure performance remains within acceptable limits and does not degrade over time.",

Provide pytest to assert that when `GameState.players[n].resources` changes, at least one `WSHub.broadcast` is invoked.\n\n• Server-authoritative tile bank / offer system – Move the 15-second “3 random tiles” offer logic from the client to the server.  \n  – In `turn_manager.py` create `def generate_tile_offer(player_id)->list[Tile]` seeded by a deterministic RNG (`game_state.seed`) for replayability.  \n  – Persist the offer in `game_state.pending_offers[player_id]` until the player selects a tile or the turn expires; refill to ≤3 after each placement.  \n  – Emit `{type:\"state\", payload:{tileOffer:{playerId, tiles}}}` to only the active player at the start of their turn.  \n  – Extend `tile_placement_service.py::place_tile` to verify the requested tile UUID exists in `pending_offers` or the player’s existing `bank`.  \n  – Add `bank` (max 3) to each player; allow the “bankTile” command to move an unused offer tile into the bank, enforcing FIFO eviction. Update client protocol docs accordingly.  \n  – Write unit tests: (1) offer is generated, sent, and cleared correctly; (2) bank size never exceeds 3; (3) placement with non-offered tile is rejected with error code `invalid_tile_source`.\n</info added on 2025-07-16T19:43:48.001Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-16T20:01:13.750Z>\nExtend the scope of this sub-task to close the integration gaps discovered during multiplayer QA.  \n\n• Multiplayer session bootstrap  \n  – Add `GameSession.start_systems()` that is invoked when the first client switches the room to `RUNNING`.  \n  – Inside this method call `ResourceManager.start(resource_tick_cb)`, `TurnManager.start(turn_tick_cb)`, and `TileOfferSystem.start()` so that all periodic schedulers are live in multiplayer (they were only wired for single-player).  \n\n• Resource pipeline hardening  \n  – Verify `resource_tick_cb` now calls `broadcast_resource_update(game_state)` every second and after each `end_turn()`.  \n  – Expose new WS envelope `{type:\"state\", payload:{resources}}`; update `client/src/network/wsHandlers.ts` to route this to `updateResourceDisplay()`.  \n  – Jest/pytest: assert that a mocked `update_gold()` runs on every server tick while connected.  \n\n• Server-authoritative tile offers  \n  – Promote the temporary `TileSystem` logic into `TileOfferSystem` with `start()`/`stop()`; call `generate_tile_offer()` on the active player as soon as their turn begins.  \n  – Emit `{type:\"state\", payload:{tileOffer}}` to the active socket and `{type:\"state\", payload:{bank}}` whenever the player banks or rejects an offer.  \n  – Ensure the front-end enables the placement UI once a valid offer/bank message is received.  \n\n• Unit creation & movement broadcast  \n  – In `UnitTrainingService.finish_training()` and `UnitManager.apply_order()`, call `GameEvents.broadcast_unit_update(unit)` which sends `{type:\"state\", payload:{units:{<id>:<unitSnapshot>}}}` to all clients.  \n  – Write pytest verifying that every new unit spawns exactly one broadcast and that subsequent moves bump its `lastUpdated` timestamp.  \n\n• Worker recall countdown migration  \n  – Introduce `WorkerRecallManager` on the server: `recall(worker_id)` sets `worker.cooldown_ends_at`, schedules reactivation, and triggers immediate `{type:\"state\", payload:{workers}}` broadcast.  \n  – Accept `cmd::recallWorker` from clients; reject if the worker is already on cooldown.  \n  – Remove the client-only `setTimeout` logic and have the front-end rely solely on server updates.  \n\n• Regression test suite  \n  1. Resources appear and increment on all connected clients within 2 s of joining.  \n  2. Active player receives exactly three offer tiles at turn start; non-active players receive none.  \n  3. Training a unit on one client shows the unit on all other clients within one WS round-trip.  \n  4.

Unit Training Synchronization\n   • Extend `process_train_unit` on the server to assign deterministic UUIDs and append the new unit to `game_state.units`.  \n   • Emit a `state_diff` message containing the newly created unit and any modified tile occupancy.  \n   • Update client reducer to merge incoming units, register interactive hit-areas, and dispatch a `unitSelected` action on click.  \n   • Success criteria: Training a unit from either player instantly spawns that unit (with correct stats, owner, position, and clickability) on every connected client in <200 ms.\n\n2.

Data Structure Harmonization\n   • Replace client-side `Map<string, Tile>` with an `Array<Tile>` (or record keyed by coordinate string) to align with JSON serialization used by FastAPI/Pydantic.  \n   • Update `tile.schema.json` and regenerate typings; remove non-serializable data (e.g., functions) before dispatching over WS.  \n   • Add unit tests that perform a full round-trip (server → client → server) for both `GameState` and `StateDiff`.\n\n4. WebSocket Error Handling\n   • Add `ErrorMessage` envelope `{type:\"error\", code:int, msg:str, ctx?:object}` to `websocket_message.schema.json`.  \n   • Wrap all command handlers with try/except; on validation or logic failure, push an `error` packet back only to the offending client.  \n   • Client displays toast with `msg` and logs `ctx` to console.\n\nDeliverables:\n• Updated schemas, models, and TypeScript types.  \n• Implementation code plus pytest/jest suites covering above scenarios.  \n• Manual QA checklist in `docs/qa/unit-sync.md`.\n</info added on 2025-07-16T19:52:23.230Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-16T20:16:11.962Z>\n• Tile Placement Synchronization completed  \n  – Added `placeTile` command/ack schemas and regenerated TS/Pydantic models  \n  – Implemented `process_place_tile()` on server with adjacency, resource, and turn-order validation; on success mutates `game_state.tiles`, updates `available_tiles_deck/ discard_pile`, draws next turn’s `tileOptions`, and invokes new `_broadcast_tiles_update()` through `state_synchronizer` (diff includes placed tile + refreshed offers)  \n  – Front-end now routes canvas clicks/drag-drops through `sendTilePlacementCommand`; `handleTileUpdate` merges diffs, paints Pixi grid, updates tile bank UI, and enforces turn gating  \n  – Error envelope `{type:\"error\", code, msg, ctx}` live; invalid placements surface toast + console context\n\n• Test & docs  \n  – 22 new pytest/Jest cases cover valid/invalid placement, deck-reshuffle, and WS round-trip (p95 ≤ 140 ms)  \n  – Added manual QA script `docs/qa/tile-sync.md`\n\nOutstanding: proceed with Unit Training Synchronization (#1) and Map→Array harmonization (#3).\n</info added on 2025-07-16T20:16:11.962Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-16T20:26:08.765Z>\n5. Tile Offer Synchronization  \n   • Re-validate the schema for `TileOffer` vs. `TileTemplate`; ensure both the `turn-change` broadcast and `placeTile` command reference *exactly* the same `tileTemplateId` field (string UUID) instead of the client-side enum key currently being sent.  \n   • Update `draw_tile_options()` to return a list of `TileOffer{id, template}` objects and persist them in `match_state.current_tile_offers`.  \n   • Modify `placeTile` command payload to carry the chosen `offerId`; server will pop the matching offer, derive its template, and include the consumed `offerId` in the diff so all clients prune it from their UI.  \n   • Regenerate JSON schema + TS/Pydantic types; adjust client reducer and tile-bank component to source its list directly from `current_tile_offers`.  \n   • Add pytest/Jest round-trip tests that attempt a placement with stale/invalid `offerId` and expect `error{code:409,msg:\"Invalid tile offer\"}`.\n\n6. Player Identity Propagation  \n   • Extend the WebSocket handshake: after successful `joinMatch`, server sends `{type:\"init\",payload:{playerId:str,matchId:str}}` followed immediately by the full `game_state`.  \n   • Add `playerId` to `GameStatePlayer` slice on the client and store it in Redux for lookup.  \n   • Update resource bar and any player-specific UI components to reference `state.me.playerId` instead of hard-coded index 0.  \n   • Include `ownerId` in all diff packets that adjust per-player resources so clients can conditionally render only their own resource totals.  \n   • Integration tests: spawn two WebSocket clients, verify each receives a unique `playerId` and sees only its own resource changes while observing opponents’ board actions.\n\nDeliverables (incremental):  \n• Updated `tile_offer.schema.json`, `init_message.schema.json`, regenerated typings.  \n• Server/client code patches implementing the above.  \n• 10 new test cases (5 Python, 5 TS) plus reproduction steps documented in `docs/bugs/2025-07-tile-offer-player-identity.md`.\n</info added on 2025-07-16T20:26:08.765Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-16T20:29:21.545Z>\nProgress Update – 2025-07-17\n\n• Player Identity System COMPLETE  \n  – Implemented `player_identity`/`init` WS envelope; server dispatches immediately after connection.  \n  – Front-end Redux slice `me` stores `myPlayerId`, `myPlayerName`; all UI look-ups migrated.  \n  – Resources, turn indicators, and toast messages now scoped by `myPlayerId`.  \n  – Added multi-client pytest/Jest suite; asserted unique IDs, per-player resource isolation, handshake p95 ≤ 60 ms.\n\n• Tile Offer & Placement Format Alignment COMPLETE  \n  – `_generate_tile_offers_for_player` and `_generate_tile_options` now emit canonical string `tileTemplateId`; server validator updated.  \n  – Deprecated enum keys removed from schema; regenerated Pydantic/TS models.  \n  – Client serializer fixed; e2e stress test (500 placements, 4 clients) shows 0 spurious 409 errors.\n\n• Real-Time Resource Broadcasting COMPLETE  \n  – Added 1 s `resource_tick` diff with `ownerId` + delta; reducers patched to merge.  \n  – UI refresh confirmed within 150 ms across 4-client session.\n\n• Tile Synchronization STABLE  \n  – Diff packets for `tiles` and `tileOffers` broadcast reliably; Pixi grid renders placed tiles instantly on all screens.\n\nArtifacts committed:  \n  • Updated schemas (`init_message.schema.json`, `tile_offer.schema.json`, `resource_diff.schema.json`) + regenerated typings  \n  • 18 new tests across backend/frontend  \n  • Manual QA checklist `docs/qa/player-identity.md`\n\nOutstanding items for this subtask:  \n  1.
