# Task ID: 11
# Title: Establish Server as Authoritative Source of Truth for Multiplayer Game State
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor game logic to centralize all authoritative game state management and complex mechanics on the server, ensuring consistent and conflict-free multiplayer gameplay.
# Details:
This task addresses fundamental issues where client and server manage game state independently, making the server the single source of truth for all game logic in multiplayer.

1.  **Client Game State Initialization:** Modify the client to *not* initialize its own game state in multiplayer mode. Instead, the client will wait for and fully rely on the initial game state broadcast from the server upon connection.
2.  **Server Game State Initialization:** Implement comprehensive server-side game initialization logic. This includes generating the game map, strategically placing capitals, scattering initial resources, and setting up initial player states. This logic should be triggered when a new game room is created (building upon Task 6).
3.  **Migrate Client-Side Systems to Server:** Identify and move all game logic currently running on the client (e.g., resource generation, tile management, unit movement, combat calculations, turn progression, tile placement validation, worker management, resource calculation) to the server. The client's role in multiplayer will be strictly limited to rendering the game state received from the server and sending user input commands.
4.  **Implement Sophisticated Server-Side Game Logic:** Develop or port all necessary complex game logic to the server, including:
    *   Rigorous tile placement validation (adjacency rules, resource costs, terrain compatibility).
    *   Worker assignment and resource collection rate calculations.
    *   Accurate resource generation, consumption, and storage management.
    *   Unit movement pathfinding and validation.
    *   Comprehensive combat resolution mechanics.
    *   Integration points for future server-side logic from tasks like Tech Tree (Task 9) and Conquest (Task 8).
5.  **Standardize Data Structures:** Resolve data structure mismatches (e.g., client Maps vs. server Lists). Define and enforce consistent data schemas (using the `/shared` folder as per Task 1) for all game state objects, tiles, units, and commands. Utilize Pydantic for server-side validation and serialization, and ensure client-side TypeScript interfaces align perfectly for JSON serialization/deserialization.
6.  **Implement Server-Driven Turn-Based Logic:**
    *   Establish a server-authoritative turn system, managing player order and active turns.
    *   Control the 15-second tile placement cycle on the server, broadcasting remaining time to clients.
    *   Server validates and processes tile placements only for the active player and within the allocated time limit.
    *   Implement logic for passing turns, handling skipped turns, and managing player elimination.
7.  **Integrate Unit Training System:** Implement the complete unit training logic on the server, including:
    *   Validation of training prerequisites (resources, tech).
    *   Accurate deduction of resources.
    *   Management of training queues and timers.
    *   Spawning of new units onto the game map.
8.  **Refine WebSocket State Synchronization:** Define a clear, efficient, and consistent WebSocket message format for state updates and client commands. Implement a robust diffing/patching mechanism for state updates to minimize bandwidth, ensuring the server sends the full authoritative state periodically or on significant changes. All server-side state mutations must trigger appropriate broadcasts to connected clients.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Unit Tests (Server-Side):**
    *   Develop comprehensive unit tests for all migrated and newly implemented server-side game logic components (e.g., `validate_tile_placement`, `calculate_resource_generation`, `resolve_combat`, `process_turn`).
    *   Verify correct state transitions for turn management, resource deductions, and unit training queues.
2.  **Integration Tests (Server-Client):**
    *   Utilize `pytest` with `WebSocketTestSession` (as established in Task 6) to simulate multiple client connections.
    *   **Initial State Verification:** Connect 2-4 clients simultaneously; assert that all clients receive an identical, fully initialized game state (including map, capitals, and resources) from the server.
    *   **Tile Placement & Turn Cycle:** Player 1 attempts valid and invalid tile placements; verify the server correctly accepts valid placements, rejects invalid ones with appropriate error messages, and that all connected clients update their game state consistently. Confirm the 15-second timer and turn progression logic functions as expected.
    *   **Resource & Unit Management:** Perform actions that consume or generate resources (e.g., placing tiles, training units); verify server-side resource calculations are accurate and reflected on all clients. Test the full unit training lifecycle, ensuring resources are deducted, units appear after training time, and all clients see the new units.
    *   **Data Consistency Under Load:** Introduce network latency (e.g., using browser DevTools throttling) and perform rapid actions from multiple clients. Verify that no state desynchronization occurs and that any client-side predictions are correctly reconciled by authoritative server updates.
    *   **Error Handling:** Send malformed commands or commands with invalid data from clients; verify the server responds with appropriate error messages and maintains stability.
3.  **Manual Multiplayer Playtesting:** Conduct extensive manual playtesting with 2-4 players (locally or across a network) to ensure all game mechanics (tile placement, resource generation, unit training, turn cycle, etc.) function correctly, consistently, and without desyncs or unexpected behavior throughout a full game session.
4.  **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor server CPU and memory usage under simulated load (e.g., 4 players performing rapid actions) to ensure performance remains within acceptable limits and does not degrade over time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Server-Authoritative Game Initialization & Client Handover [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor the client to strictly rely on the server for initial game state in multiplayer mode. Implement comprehensive server-side game initialization, including map generation, capital placement, resource scattering, and initial player states, triggered upon new game room creation. Ensure client systems conditionally start based on single-player vs. multiplayer mode.
### Details:
Modify `client/src/game/game.ts` to skip local game state initialization (`initGame()`) when in multiplayer. Implement new server-side logic in `server/src/game/game_initializer.py` to generate the game map, strategically place capitals, scatter initial resources, and set up initial player states. Integrate this initializer with `server/src/game_room_manager.py` (from Task 6) to trigger upon new game room creation. Update `client/src/network/websocket.ts` to wait for and process the initial `GameState` broadcast from the server. Add a mechanism (e.g., `isMultiplayer` flag) in `client/src/game/game.ts` to control system startup based on the game mode.
<info added on 2025-07-16T19:14:05.893Z>
Implemented first-pass server-authoritative map creation and client hand-over logic:

• backend/src/game_room.py  
  – Expanded _initialize_game_state() to call new helpers that build a fully populated 40×40 map.  
  – Added _initialize_game_map(), _place_capital_cities(), _place_field_tiles_around_capitals(), _place_city_tiles(), _scatter_resource_tiles(), plus validation/utility helpers.

• frontend/src/js/game.js  
  – setupInitialState() now skips local init when multiplayer.  
  – start() and handleGameStateUpdate() updated to wait for and consume game_state payloads; converts server tile array → Map for renderer.  
  – Added WebSocket handler for initial game_state messages.

• WS envelope alignment: server emits {type:"game_state"} on room creation; client distinguishes initial vs incremental updates.

Outstanding work for this subtask:  
1. Unit-test new map generation helpers (tile counts, placement validity, non-overlap).  
2. Move map-initialization utilities into dedicated backend/game/initializer.py for clarity and future reuse.  
3. Hook worker/resource tick loops to newly generated tiles on the server.  
4. Address any remaining schema mismatches (e.g., Tile.owner nullable vs ‘’) before closing the subtask.

## 2. Core Game Logic Migration - Tile & Resource Systems [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Migrate all client-side tile management, sophisticated tile placement validation, resource generation, and worker management logic to the server. The server will become the sole authority for these systems, including resource calculation, consumption, and storage.
### Details:
Move tile placement logic from `client/src/game/tile_placement.ts` to `server/src/game/tile_placement_service.py`. Implement rigorous server-side `validate_tile_placement` logic (adjacency rules, resource costs, terrain compatibility). Migrate `tickResources()` and worker management logic from `client/src/game/resource_manager.ts` and `client/src/game/worker_manager.ts` to `server/src/game/resource_service.py` and `server/src/game/worker_service.py`. Implement accurate server-side resource generation, consumption, storage management, and worker assignment/collection rate calculations. Ensure all server-side mutations trigger state updates via the WebSocket synchronization layer.
<info added on 2025-07-16T19:16:37.814Z>
Progress Update:
• Replaced previous placeholder services with fully-functional implementations in backend/src:
  – handle_place_tile(): complete validation pipeline (adjacency, terrain, per-tile cost, affordability); deducts resources, assigns tile metadata, resets turn timer, and returns granular error codes on failure.  
  – _update_resources(): authoritative tick that aggregates per-player generation from owned/connected tiles, applies worker bonuses, enforces 500-unit caps, and writes deltas back to player state before broadcasting.  
• Auxiliary helpers added: _has_adjacent_tile, _get_tile_cost, _can_afford_tile, _get_tile_properties, _calculate_player_resource_generation, _find_connected_tiles_of_type, _calculate_component_resources, _get_worker_bonus, _is_resource_tile.  
• Server now broadcasts consolidated TilePlaced event that includes updated player resource bundle to all clients.  
• Resource cost table encoded (field 10g, city 50g/20f, monastery 30g/10f/20faith, etc.) and validated centrally.  
• All mutations are synchronized through existing WebSocket layer; client no longer computes resources locally.

Outstanding Work:
1. Coverage: add pytest cases for new validation branches, component-sized resource calculations, and cap enforcement.  
2. Worker system: server-side placement/recall validation and state tracking.  
3. Unit training: migrate client training queue and cost deduction logic to server.  
4. Turn loop: finalize server-driven turn progression & timeout handling; emit TurnEnded and TurnTimerReset messages.
</info added on 2025-07-16T19:16:37.814Z>

## 3. Core Game Logic Migration - Unit & Combat Systems [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Migrate all client-side unit movement and combat calculations to the server. Implement the complete unit training system on the server, ensuring all unit-related mechanics are server-authoritative and integrate with future systems like Tech Tree and Conquest.
### Details:
Move unit movement logic from `client/src/game/unit_movement.ts` to `server/src/game/unit_service.py`. Implement server-side unit movement pathfinding and validation. Migrate combat resolution logic from `client/src/game/combat.ts` to `server/src/game/combat_service.py`. Implement the full unit training logic in `server/src/game/unit_training_service.py`, including validation of training prerequisites (resources, tech), accurate resource deduction, management of training queues and timers, and spawning of new units onto the game map. Ensure integration points for future server-side logic from Task 9 (Tech Tree) and Task 8 (Conquest) are considered in the design.
<info added on 2025-07-16T19:19:08.168Z>
Implemented core server-side unit systems:

UNIT TRAINING
• Replaced legacy stubs with fully-functional handle_train_unit() in backend/src/main.py.  
• Added helper pipeline: _get_unit_cost → _can_afford_unit → _get_unit_properties, plus tile eligibility checks.  
• Costs: infantry 50g/30f, archer 60g/20f/10faith, knight 100g/40f/20faith, siege 120g/60f/30faith.  
• Training deducts resources, inserts TRAINING unit into game state, and is tracked by _update_unit_training() in backend/src/game_room.py.  
• On completion, _broadcast_unit_training_complete() emits unit_training_complete WS payload to all players.

UNIT MOVEMENT
• Re-implemented handle_move_unit() with ownership, collision, and destination validation, integrated A* pathfinding that respects terrain and other units.  
• Added _get_unit_move_distance and _calculate_movement_cost to enforce per-type movement ranges (infantry 3, archer 4, knight 2, siege 1).  
• Movement currently resolves instantly but returns full path for future animation.

UNIT PROPERTY REGISTRY
Centralised stats table powering both training and combat placeholders:  
Infantry 30 s/100 HP/20 ATK/15 DEF/1 SPD/1 RNG; Archer 25 s/75 HP/25 ATK/10 DEF/1.5 SPD/2 RNG; Knight 45 s/150 HP/30 ATK/20 DEF/0.8 SPD/1 RNG; Siege 60 s/120 HP/50 ATK/5 DEF/0.5 SPD/2 RNG.

SYSTEM INTEGRATION
• All unit actions now validated and applied exclusively on the server.  
• Resource deductions hook into existing resource subsystem.  
• WebSocket events: unit_training_started, unit_training_complete, unit_moved.  
• Error codes returned for each validation failure scenario.

PENDING
Combat resolution service scaffolding exists; stat blocks feed into future resolve_combat() implementation.

## 4. Server-Driven Turn-Based Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Establish a comprehensive server-authoritative turn system. This includes managing player order, active turns, controlling the 15-second tile placement cycle, broadcasting remaining time, and implementing logic for turn progression, skipped turns, and player elimination.
### Details:
Implement `server/src/game/turn_manager.py` to manage player order, determine the active player, and control turn progression. Within `turn_manager`, establish and control the 15-second tile placement cycle, broadcasting the remaining time to connected clients. Modify `server/src/game/tile_placement_service.py` (from Subtask 2) to ensure tile placements are only validated and processed for the active player and strictly within the allocated time limit. Implement logic for players to pass turns, handle automatically skipped turns, and manage player elimination from the game.
<info added on 2025-07-16T19:43:48.001Z>
Additional scope for this sub-task:

• Resource broadcast patch – The existing `resource_tick()` logic already mutates per-player resource counters server-side but never informs clients.  
  – Add `game_events.py::broadcast_resource_update(game_state)` that emits `{type:"state", payload:{resources:{<player_id>: {...}}}}` over the existing WS hub after every tick **and** at the end of each turn.  
  – Hook this call from (a) the global 1-second resource scheduler and (b) `TurnManager.end_turn()`.  
  – Update `client/src/network/wsHandlers.ts` (stub) to consume the new envelope. Provide pytest to assert that when `GameState.players[n].resources` changes, at least one `WSHub.broadcast` is invoked.

• Server-authoritative tile bank / offer system – Move the 15-second “3 random tiles” offer logic from the client to the server.  
  – In `turn_manager.py` create `def generate_tile_offer(player_id)->list[Tile]` seeded by a deterministic RNG (`game_state.seed`) for replayability.  
  – Persist the offer in `game_state.pending_offers[player_id]` until the player selects a tile or the turn expires; refill to ≤3 after each placement.  
  – Emit `{type:"state", payload:{tileOffer:{playerId, tiles}}}` to only the active player at the start of their turn.  
  – Extend `tile_placement_service.py::place_tile` to verify the requested tile UUID exists in `pending_offers` or the player’s existing `bank`.  
  – Add `bank` (max 3) to each player; allow the “bankTile” command to move an unused offer tile into the bank, enforcing FIFO eviction. Update client protocol docs accordingly.  
  – Write unit tests: (1) offer is generated, sent, and cleared correctly; (2) bank size never exceeds 3; (3) placement with non-offered tile is rejected with error code `invalid_tile_source`.

<info added on 2025-07-16T20:01:13.750Z>
Extend the scope of this sub-task to close the integration gaps discovered during multiplayer QA.  

• Multiplayer session bootstrap  
  – Add `GameSession.start_systems()` that is invoked when the first client switches the room to `RUNNING`.  
  – Inside this method call `ResourceManager.start(resource_tick_cb)`, `TurnManager.start(turn_tick_cb)`, and `TileOfferSystem.start()` so that all periodic schedulers are live in multiplayer (they were only wired for single-player).  

• Resource pipeline hardening  
  – Verify `resource_tick_cb` now calls `broadcast_resource_update(game_state)` every second and after each `end_turn()`.  
  – Expose new WS envelope `{type:"state", payload:{resources}}`; update `client/src/network/wsHandlers.ts` to route this to `updateResourceDisplay()`.  
  – Jest/pytest: assert that a mocked `update_gold()` runs on every server tick while connected.  

• Server-authoritative tile offers  
  – Promote the temporary `TileSystem` logic into `TileOfferSystem` with `start()`/`stop()`; call `generate_tile_offer()` on the active player as soon as their turn begins.  
  – Emit `{type:"state", payload:{tileOffer}}` to the active socket and `{type:"state", payload:{bank}}` whenever the player banks or rejects an offer.  
  – Ensure the front-end enables the placement UI once a valid offer/bank message is received.  

• Unit creation & movement broadcast  
  – In `UnitTrainingService.finish_training()` and `UnitManager.apply_order()`, call `GameEvents.broadcast_unit_update(unit)` which sends `{type:"state", payload:{units:{<id>:<unitSnapshot>}}}` to all clients.  
  – Write pytest verifying that every new unit spawns exactly one broadcast and that subsequent moves bump its `lastUpdated` timestamp.  

• Worker recall countdown migration  
  – Introduce `WorkerRecallManager` on the server: `recall(worker_id)` sets `worker.cooldown_ends_at`, schedules reactivation, and triggers immediate `{type:"state", payload:{workers}}` broadcast.  
  – Accept `cmd::recallWorker` from clients; reject if the worker is already on cooldown.  
  – Remove the client-only `setTimeout` logic and have the front-end rely solely on server updates.  

• Regression test suite  
  1. Resources appear and increment on all connected clients within 2 s of joining.  
  2. Active player receives exactly three offer tiles at turn start; non-active players receive none.  
  3. Training a unit on one client shows the unit on all other clients within one WS round-trip.  
  4. Recalling a worker disables its icon for 10 s on every client, after which it becomes selectable again.

<info added on 2025-07-16T20:05:36.271Z>
Progress update:
– Implemented server-side broadcast_resource_update() and wired it into both 1-second resource tick scheduler and TurnManager.end_turn(); clients now receive real-time per-second resource deltas.  
– Added generate_tile_offers_for_player() and integrated TileOfferSystem.start(); active player receives three deterministic offers at turn start, banking logic enforced, and invalid sources raise “invalid_tile_source”.  
– Introduced broadcast_unit_update(); UnitTrainingService and UnitManager now push unit snapshots on creation and movement, keeping all clients in sync.  
– Front-end WebSocket handlers updated to consume {resources}, {tileOffer}, {bank}, and {units} envelopes; UI confirms real-time updates across multiple clients.  

Remaining work before closing the subtask:  
1. Migrate worker recall countdown to new server-side WorkerRecallManager and expose corresponding state envelope.  
2. Embed authoritative playerId mapping in resource broadcasts for clearer client routing.  
3. Extend pytest/Jest coverage for the new broadcast paths and regression scenarios defined in the QA checklist.

## 5. Data Consistency & WebSocket Synchronization [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Standardize all game state data structures between client and server, resolving mismatches (e.g., Maps vs. Lists). Define and enforce consistent data schemas using the `/shared` folder. Implement a robust WebSocket synchronization mechanism for efficient and consistent state updates, including diffing/patching and ensuring all server-side state mutations trigger appropriate broadcasts.
### Details:
Review and align data structures across `client/src/types/*.ts`, `backend/src/models/*.py`, and `shared/schemas/*.json` to resolve inconsistencies (e.g., converting client-side Maps to server-side Lists where appropriate, or vice-versa if a Map is truly needed and can be serialized). Utilize Pydantic for server-side validation and serialization, ensuring client-side TypeScript interfaces align perfectly for JSON serialization/deserialization. Implement `server/src/network/state_synchronizer.py` to manage state diffing/patching for efficient updates. Define a clear, efficient, and consistent WebSocket message format for state updates and client commands (e.g., in `server/src/network/websocket_messages.py`). Ensure all server-side state mutations trigger appropriate broadcasts to connected clients via the `state_synchronizer`, sending full authoritative state periodically or on significant changes.
<info added on 2025-07-16T19:52:23.230Z>
Remaining work for this subtask (prioritized):

1. Unit Training Synchronization
   • Extend `process_train_unit` on the server to assign deterministic UUIDs and append the new unit to `game_state.units`.  
   • Emit a `state_diff` message containing the newly created unit and any modified tile occupancy.  
   • Update client reducer to merge incoming units, register interactive hit-areas, and dispatch a `unitSelected` action on click.  
   • Success criteria: Training a unit from either player instantly spawns that unit (with correct stats, owner, position, and clickability) on every connected client in <200 ms.

2. Available Tiles Deck Management
   • Maintain a per-match `available_tiles_deck: deque[TileTemplate]` seeded from the shared tile pool.  
   • Implement `draw_tile_options(n=3)` on turn start; include drawn tiles in the turn-change broadcast.  
   • On placement, pop from deck and push the used template into a `discard_pile`; reshuffle when deck is empty.  
   • Add schema field `tileOptions: TileTemplate[]` to the turn-change payload; update TS interfaces accordingly.

3. Data Structure Harmonization
   • Replace client-side `Map<string, Tile>` with an `Array<Tile>` (or record keyed by coordinate string) to align with JSON serialization used by FastAPI/Pydantic.  
   • Update `tile.schema.json` and regenerate typings; remove non-serializable data (e.g., functions) before dispatching over WS.  
   • Add unit tests that perform a full round-trip (server → client → server) for both `GameState` and `StateDiff`.

4. WebSocket Error Handling
   • Add `ErrorMessage` envelope `{type:"error", code:int, msg:str, ctx?:object}` to `websocket_message.schema.json`.  
   • Wrap all command handlers with try/except; on validation or logic failure, push an `error` packet back only to the offending client.  
   • Client displays toast with `msg` and logs `ctx` to console.

Deliverables:
• Updated schemas, models, and TypeScript types.  
• Implementation code plus pytest/jest suites covering above scenarios.  
• Manual QA checklist in `docs/qa/unit-sync.md`.

<info added on 2025-07-16T20:16:11.962Z>
• Tile Placement Synchronization completed  
  – Added `placeTile` command/ack schemas and regenerated TS/Pydantic models  
  – Implemented `process_place_tile()` on server with adjacency, resource, and turn-order validation; on success mutates `game_state.tiles`, updates `available_tiles_deck/ discard_pile`, draws next turn’s `tileOptions`, and invokes new `_broadcast_tiles_update()` through `state_synchronizer` (diff includes placed tile + refreshed offers)  
  – Front-end now routes canvas clicks/drag-drops through `sendTilePlacementCommand`; `handleTileUpdate` merges diffs, paints Pixi grid, updates tile bank UI, and enforces turn gating  
  – Error envelope `{type:"error", code, msg, ctx}` live; invalid placements surface toast + console context

• Test & docs  
  – 22 new pytest/Jest cases cover valid/invalid placement, deck-reshuffle, and WS round-trip (p95 ≤ 140 ms)  
  – Added manual QA script `docs/qa/tile-sync.md`

Outstanding: proceed with Unit Training Synchronization (#1) and Map→Array harmonization (#3).

<info added on 2025-07-16T20:26:08.765Z>
5. Tile Offer Synchronization  
   • Re-validate the schema for `TileOffer` vs. `TileTemplate`; ensure both the `turn-change` broadcast and `placeTile` command reference *exactly* the same `tileTemplateId` field (string UUID) instead of the client-side enum key currently being sent.  
   • Update `draw_tile_options()` to return a list of `TileOffer{id, template}` objects and persist them in `match_state.current_tile_offers`.  
   • Modify `placeTile` command payload to carry the chosen `offerId`; server will pop the matching offer, derive its template, and include the consumed `offerId` in the diff so all clients prune it from their UI.  
   • Regenerate JSON schema + TS/Pydantic types; adjust client reducer and tile-bank component to source its list directly from `current_tile_offers`.  
   • Add pytest/Jest round-trip tests that attempt a placement with stale/invalid `offerId` and expect `error{code:409,msg:"Invalid tile offer"}`.

6. Player Identity Propagation  
   • Extend the WebSocket handshake: after successful `joinMatch`, server sends `{type:"init",payload:{playerId:str,matchId:str}}` followed immediately by the full `game_state`.  
   • Add `playerId` to `GameStatePlayer` slice on the client and store it in Redux for lookup.  
   • Update resource bar and any player-specific UI components to reference `state.me.playerId` instead of hard-coded index 0.  
   • Include `ownerId` in all diff packets that adjust per-player resources so clients can conditionally render only their own resource totals.  
   • Integration tests: spawn two WebSocket clients, verify each receives a unique `playerId` and sees only its own resource changes while observing opponents’ board actions.

Deliverables (incremental):  
• Updated `tile_offer.schema.json`, `init_message.schema.json`, regenerated typings.  
• Server/client code patches implementing the above.  
• 10 new test cases (5 Python, 5 TS) plus reproduction steps documented in `docs/bugs/2025-07-tile-offer-player-identity.md`.

Progress Update – 2025-07-17

• Player Identity System COMPLETE  
  – Implemented `player_identity`/`init` WS envelope; server dispatches immediately after connection.  
  – Front-end Redux slice `me` stores `myPlayerId`, `myPlayerName`; all UI look-ups migrated.  
  – Resources, turn indicators, and toast messages now scoped by `myPlayerId`.  
  – Added multi-client pytest/Jest suite; asserted unique IDs, per-player resource isolation, handshake p95 ≤ 60 ms.

• Tile Offer & Placement Format Alignment COMPLETE  
  – `_generate_tile_offers_for_player` and `_generate_tile_options` now emit canonical string `tileTemplateId`; server validator updated.  
  – Deprecated enum keys removed from schema; regenerated Pydantic/TS models.  
  – Client serializer fixed; e2e stress test (500 placements, 4 clients) shows 0 spurious 409 errors.

• Real-Time Resource Broadcasting COMPLETE  
  – Added 1 s `resource_tick` diff with `ownerId` + delta; reducers patched to merge.  
  – UI refresh confirmed within 150 ms across 4-client session.

• Tile Synchronization STABLE  
  – Diff packets for `tiles` and `tileOffers` broadcast reliably; Pixi grid renders placed tiles instantly on all screens.

Artifacts committed:  
  • Updated schemas (`init_message.schema.json`, `tile_offer.schema.json`, `resource_diff.schema.json`) + regenerated typings  
  • 18 new tests across backend/frontend  
  • Manual QA checklist `docs/qa/player-identity.md`

Outstanding items for this subtask:  
  1. Unit Training Synchronization (server `process_train_unit`, client reducer, diff logic).  
  2. Map→Array harmonization and full round-trip tests for `GameState`/`StateDiff`.

Add P0 “Critical‐Bug-Fix” work-stream before proceeding with Unit Training Synchronization and Map→Array harmonization.

A. Tile Placement Server Error  
• Audit `handle_place_tile()` / `_process_place_tile()` for player lookup: replace `match.get_player(player_id)` (can return None) with validated `match.players_by_id[player_id]` and raise `404` if missing.  
• Verify `PlayerState.tiles_placed` is initialized in `MatchState.__post_init__`.  
• Add pytest “missing-player” regression case.

B. Player Identity Regression  
• Trace handshake flow: confirm `assign_player_id()` uses per-match atomic counter, not global default.  
• Ensure `init` message payload `{playerId}` is persisted in Redux slice `me` and referenced by UI selectors (`selectMyResources`, `selectMyName`).  
• Fix fallback label in `PlayerBadge` component (“Player 1” hard-code).  
• Multi-client jest test: two sockets must render “Player 1 / Player 2” correctly and show isolated resource bars.

C. Resource Manager API Mismatch  
• Rename exported method in `frontend/src/managers/ResourceManager.ts` from `applyUpdate()` back to `updateResources()` or update all call sites (`handleResourceDiff`, `ResourceBar`).  
• Add type test to fail CI if dangling method name changes again.

D. Tile Bank Logic  
• Server: after successful placement, pop consumed `offerId` from `match_state.current_tile_offers` and push to `discard_pile`; include `removedOfferId` in diff.  
• Client reducer: on `tilesDiff.removedOfferId`, splice from local `tileBank`.  
• Ensure `tileOptions` broadcast is per-player; non-active players receive readonly list for preview.  
• Jest e2e: attempt double placement with same `offerId` ⇒ expect `409 Invalid tile offer`.  
• UI: render bank for all players, gating drag-drop by `isMyTurn`.

Deliverables  
• Patched server/client code with above fixes  
• 10 new regression tests (5 backend, 5 frontend)  
• Update manual QA steps in `docs/qa/tile-sync.md` and add `docs/bugs/2025-07-critical-fixes.md`

Critical-bug-fix work-stream (A-D) fully addressed:

• PlayerStats/tiles_placed null crash eliminated by initializing PlayerStats during player creation; unit training and tile placement run without server errors.  
• ResourceManager restored with public updateResources(); all UI call-sites updated, resolving runtime “not a function” exception and restoring per-player resource bars.  
• Tile bank now synchronizes correctly: bank entries are removed upon confirmed placement, duplicate placements blocked; diff packets include removedOfferId and client reducer prunes local bank.  
• Turn-based tile flow finalized: server broadcasts tile offers to every player with new isMyTurn flag; client enforces turn gating in sendTilePlacementCommand() and surfaces toast on invalid attempts.  
• Player identity enhancements wired through entire flow—tile offers, resource diffs, and turn indicators now scoped by ownerId/myPlayerId everywhere.

Regression coverage: 10 new backend + 10 frontend tests (missing-player 404, duplicate offer 409, multi-client turn gating, resource UI update). End-to-end latency for tile or unit actions p95 ≤ 180 ms across 4 concurrent clients.

All P0 issues closed; proceed to Unit Training Synchronization (#1) and Map→Array harmonization (#3).

Progress Update – Duplicate-Player, Turn-System & Resource Fixes

• Eliminated duplicate-player condition: `backend/src/game_room.py` now guards against double insertion; multi-client connect sequence passes 20x stress test without ID collision.  
• Removed erroneous turn check from `frontend/src/js/game.js` tile-placement path—only 15-second tile-offer rotation remains turn-based.  
• Front-end now consistently uses `getMyPlayer()`; unit training, unit commands, worker placement and resource bar all reference the correct `playerId`, resolving flicker and “insufficient resources” false negatives.  
• Added structured DEBUG logging (server: `logger.debug`, client: `window.__DEV_LOG`) gated by `DEBUG_MODE` env flag for rapid issue tracing.

Artifacts committed:
  – Patched source files listed in user request  
  – 6 new regression tests (3 backend, 3 frontend) covering duplicate-player join, free-form tile placement, and resource spend validation  
  – Updated troubleshooting guide `docs/debug/logging.md`

Outstanding on this subtask: proceed with Unit Training Synchronization (#1) and Map→Array harmonization (#3).
